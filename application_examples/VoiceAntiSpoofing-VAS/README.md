# Voice Anti-Spoofing - VAS
## Overview
This repository hosts the supporting content for **Renesas Ready Solutions** in **Artificial Intelligence of Things** (*#aiot*) on **Renesas Microcontrollers**.

###Description
As systems get increasingly complex, it is important to limit access to data or system settings to prevent accidental triggers by things like radio or television. The challenge is how to do this without cloud access and avoid unintentional spoofing. Traditional solutions to access control rely on high-power computing or remote connection to cloud services. If you want to avoid spoof access, the only other solution has been to employ a separate, powerful computing engine. The Renesas voice anti-spoofing model was developed specifically to address these concerns.
